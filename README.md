This repository contains the source code for the T41-EP Software Defined Transceiver by AC8GY and W8TEE.

The source code is collected from the SoftwareControlledHamRadio groups.io page.

h3. Modifications
I have made the following modifications from the distributed .zip files:
# Normalized line endings--different versions of the distributed source code have a mixture of Windows and UNIX line endings, and sometimes entire files change line endings between versions.  Normalization makes diffs between versions simpler.
# Standarized the main program filename to SDT.ino.  In the distributed source code, the file is renamed with each version, in the pattern SDTVer<ver>.ino.  Again, this change is made primarily to increase the usability of inter-version diffs.
